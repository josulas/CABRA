	abstract = {Evoked Potentials are electrical potentials that occur in a group of neurons in response to stimulation of a sensory organ which can be recorded by surface electrodes. Testing evoked potentials is useful in assessing the integrity of neuronal pathways both at sensory and motor levels of neural control. Early auditory evoked potentials include cochlear and brainstem auditory-evoked potentials, popularly known as electrocochleogram, and auditory brainstem response. Evoked potential audiometry is a neurophysiogical test to assess auditory pathway function in response to auditory stimuli. Auditory brainstem response mainly assesses brainstem functions and integrity. These evoked potentials are widely used for assessment of the cochlear functions, auditory nerve and the brainstem. Most common indications for auditory evoked potentials include routine newborn hearing screening for auditory pathway deficits, detecting retrocochlear pathologies, intraoperative and intensive care monitoring, frequency-related measurement of auditory sensitivity and for diagnosing some demyelinating disorders in initial stages. The current narrative review was planned to highlight auditory brainstem response recording's basic principles, uses and methods of interpretation in health and disease phases.},

	url = {https://repository.library.northeastern.edu/files/neu:1362},
	abstract = {Human perception of loudness as function of a wide range of stimulus intensity is hypothesized to vary in complex ways that cannot be accounted for simply by the listener's threshold and discomfort level. The ability to estimate loudness growth as function of stimulus intensity using an objective procedure could potentially allow for customized non-linear hearing aid fitting for patients unable to perform standard subjective auditory tests. Some researchers have investigated the feasibility of using evoked auditory brainstem responses (ABR) and otoacoustic emissions (OAE) as physiological predictors of loudness growth in humans. Results from OAE studies were promising, but lacked an investigation into the selection of its parameters and a measure of the methodological performance in hearing impaired listeners. Previous studies using ABR, on the other hand, did not use frequency specific stimuli and were based on subjective segmentation techniques that did not take into account the residual noise levels in the averaged waveform. The work in this thesis aims at investigating and improving the use of simultaneously recorded tone burst OAE and ABR for assessing frequency specific loudness growth in normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners. First, an optimal set of parameters for the OAE estimator is selected based on mean square error criteria. Second, a new signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) estimation procedure is developed that attempts to take into account non-stationary noise sources present in ABR recordings. Third, several objective ABR segmentation and noise control procedures are tested for estimating loudness growth. Additionally, SNR estimates are compared with ABR loudness growth estimation errors in an attempt to examine dependencies between residual noise levels in averaged ABR waveforms and estimation performance. Results show that for normal listeners and with 1 kHz tone bursts, both OAE and ABR loudness growth estimators can perform within range of standard psychoacoustical procedures. With hearing impaired listeners, or with 4 kHz tone bursts, the performance of the OAE estimator produced a higher mean-square error with respect to a psychoacoustical measure of loudness than most of the ABR estimators. The performance of ABR estimators with hearing-impaired listeners is close to, but not as accurate as the standard psychoacoustical procedures.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Automated audiometry provides an opportunity to do audiometry when there is no direct access to a clinical audiologist. This approach will help to use hearing services and resources efficiently. The purpose of this study was to review studies related to automated audiometry by focusing on the implementation of an audiometer, the use of transducers and evaluation methods.

Methods
This review study was conducted in 2017. The papers related to the design and implementation of automated audiometry were searched in the following databases: Science Direct, Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus. The time frame for the papers was between January 1, 2010 and August 31, 2017. Initially, 143 papers were found, and after screening, the number of papers was reduced to 16.

Results
The findings showed that the implementation methods were categorized into the use of software (7 papers), hardware (3 papers) and smartphones/tablets (6 papers). The used transducers were a variety of earphones and bone vibrators. Different evaluation methods were used to evaluate the accuracy and the reliability of the diagnoses. However, in most studies, no significant difference was found between automated and traditional audiometry.

Conclusions
It seems that automated audiometry produces the same results compared with traditional audiometry. However, the main advantages of this method; namely, saving costs and increased accessibility to hearing services, can lead to a faster diagnosis of hearing impairment, especially in poor areas.},
